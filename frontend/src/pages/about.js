                A Globally Connected Sri Lankan Social Enterprise

              <p className={`text-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                FabLanka was publically launched in May 2015 to facilitate and
                nurture the growth of innovative fabrication methods in Sri
                Lanka. FabLanka Foundation (GTE) LTD was incorporated as a
                not-for-profit social enterprise in April 2016 under Companies
                Act , No 7 of 2007 of Sri Lanka.
              </p>
              <p className={`text-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                A cooperative between professionals in Sri Lanka and around the
                world, FabLanka aims to bring about educational and economic
                changes while minimizing environmental impact to Sri Lanka
                through the digital fabrication revolution.
              </p>
              <p className={`text-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                The goal of this cooperative is to develop fabrication labs at
                strategic locations throughout the island. Over time, these
                fabrication labs will connect to the larger global digital
                fabrication networks and organizations (fabfoundation.org)
                allowing local communities to innovate and invent new
                technologies and share knowledge that will positively transform
                the lives of peopl

                Towards a Makers’ society through Community Outreach
              </p>
              <p className={`card-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                Developed as a community outreach project, FabLanka allows local
                communities at any socio-economic background to channel their
                creative energy towards technological innovation. Fabrication
                labs will serve as an educational apparatus by providing the
                knowledge and tools through which communities can innovate
                according to their needs. This will empower the youth and intern
                the community towards local economic development.
              </p>
              <p className={`card-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                Communities have unique identities and needs. For digital
                fabrication methods such as additive manufacturing, unique
                necessities of each community become an advantage as opposed to
                the mass assembly line manufacturing methods of the past. In Sri
                Lanka, most cities and towns thrive on small businesses that are
                stifled by lack of technical innovation and financial burdens.
                Fabrication labs will serve small and medium scale enterprises
                (SME) by providing them with the necessary technology and
                infrastructure in the form of education, training, and product
                development capabilities that neither local governments nor
                businesses have the capacity to invest in. Innovative
                fabrication methods developed locally for local markets can help
                overcome the stagnation caused by global economic pressures and
                local economic underdevelopment.

              </p>
              <p className={`card-justify ${Styles.qcont}`}>
                The environmental degradation caused by modern economies is
                severe. Much of the raw materials and energy used for production
                is wasted in the manufacturing and transportation processes.
                Local manufacturing methods are needed to pave way for a greener
                economy. Developing countries have the advantage of not having
                to change the foundations of their economic structure to exploit
                the changes necessary for a sustainable economy. The needs of a
                sustainable economy can be met on a local level with innovative
                manufacturing methods. Fabrication labs can lead the way in
                identifying sustainable manufacturing practices for local
                economies to prosper.

                FabLanka aims to bridge the gap between advancements in
                information technology and lack of advancement in manufacturing
                techniques in Sri Lanka. In doing so, the goal is to solve
                multifaceted problems through education, innovation and building
                sustainable local communities that are globally connected.
